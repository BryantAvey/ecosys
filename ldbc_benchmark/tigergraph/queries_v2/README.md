Comment on queries: 
1. The queries work for tigergraph 3.1.0 and 3.0.0. 3.0.0 has bugs and generate wrong results for bi8 and bi22.
2. ORDER BY cannot be used for distributed query and there are some bugs for distribtued query. Some queries are not written in distributed query due to bugs. 
3. IS and IC queries usually start from a single vertex. Long linear queries are used here, but some queries are not very efficient. BI are expensive and usually divided into short-path queries. 
4. Due to bugs on to_vertex_set, IS4-7 give empty results if distributed query is used but is1-3 can be changed to distributed query. Due to bug on listAccum<VERTEX>, ic14 and bi25 cannot be installed in distributed query. Some IC queries are not written in distributed mode because some V2 IC queries with per clause are slower in distributed mode (because global MapAccum is expensive) and some V1 IC queries do not support distributed query.

## How to run Benchmarks
### install tigergraph 3.0 released version 
Tigergraph Installation and Loading for SF10000 on 24 CentOS machines: 
https://graphsql.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GRAP/pages/1347289765/LDBC+Social+Network+Benchmark+6T+local+machine

Tigergraph Installation and Loading for SF100 on AWS r4.8xlarge: 
https://graphsql.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GRAP/pages/802619473/LDBC+Social+Network+Benchmark

### Clone the repository 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tigergraph/ecosys.git
cd ecosys
git checkout ldbc
cd ldbc_benchmark/tigergraph/queries_v2
```

### Run queries
bi25 and ic14 requires user defined function, which is included in ExprFunctions.hpp. Copy the file to tigergraph package.
```bash
#get the root directory of tigergraph
ROOTDIR=$(gadmin config get System.AppRoot)

# Copy paste the user defined function to the tigergraph directory
cp ExprFunctions.hpp $ROOTDIR/dev/gdk/gsql/src/QueryUdf/ExprFunctions.hpp
```

gsql_batch.sh is the script to parse gsql files in batch. The script stores query names in environment variable $query_list and loads three functions: install, drop and run to install, drop and run those queries. For help info: run "gsql_batch.sh -h"
```bash
#parse v2 queries for SF 10000
source gsql_batch.sh queries/*.gsql queries/SF10000/*.gsql
# to parse queries for SF<100, source gsql_batch.sh queries/*.gsql queries/SF100/*.gsql
# The query list is printed out in the end. If any query fails, you can remove the failed queries and reassign value to $query_list, for example, query_list=ic1,ic2,ic3

#install the queries in $query_list
install

#run each query in query_list for 3 times. Output results in log/ and time and error info in err/
run 

#to run in background and direct output to nohup.out 
( trap "true" HUP ; run ) > nohup.out 2>/dev/null </dev/null & disown
```

### Compare Results
To compare results with results in results/SF10000. Use 'python3 compare_result.py -h' for help mesage 
```bash
#If you don't have python3, For CentOS 
yum install -y python3-devel

# Show the running time of my queries and parse the results to parsed_result/.
python3 compare_result.py 

# If you also want to compare the results with the benchmark results of SF10000
python3 compare_result.py -c result/SF10000
```

Output shows the difference of the results, and the median time of three runs. The script reads results in log/, takes the fields of interest, sorts them and dumps parsed results to parsed_result/. You can use 'diff' command or text compare tools on the parsed results and see how the results are different between your runs and gold answer in result/SF10000. The script can read old json format ('../queries_pattern_match/result/') when option '--old' is turned on.

Example output of 'python3 compare_result.py -c result/SF10000':

PASS indicate the results are the same as the target gold answer. Use "python3 compare_result.py | awk -F":" '{print $3}' | tr -d 's'" to get time information to copy paste into google sheet.
