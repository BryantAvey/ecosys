Introduction
TigerGraph 2.xi and 3.0 heavily depend on ssh. The installer creates a pair of ssh keys and distributes them to the ~/.ssh/tigergraph_rsa and ~/.ssh/authorized_keys files. 
However, some customers have security scripts that periodically remove the unauthorized ssh users by cleaning the above two files.

SSH KeyGuard is used to create an active shell session with ssh working properly.

The idea is to backup the ~/.ssh/ folder and keep overwriting the above two files until session ends, and restore the ~/.ssh/ folder afterwards.


Please watch the demo video keyguard-demo.mp4 for usage steps.
